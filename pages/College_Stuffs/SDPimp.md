## 11. Passing data using intent

In Android development, passing data between different components, such as activities or services, is commonly done using an Intent object. An Intent is a messaging object that allows you to communicate and transfer data between different components within an Android application. Here's how you can pass data using an Intent:

1. Sending Data:
    
    a. Create an Intent object: Instantiate an Intent object, specifying the source component (usually the current activity or service) and the target component (the activity or service to which you want to pass the data).
    
    ```
    Intent intent = new Intent(SourceActivity.this, TargetActivity.class);
    ```
    
    b. Add data to the Intent: You can attach data to the Intent using various methods based on the type of data you want to pass.
    
    For example, to pass a string value:
    
    ```
    intent.putExtra("key", "Hello, target activity!");
    ```
    
    c. Start the target component: Start the target activity or service by calling the appropriate method, such as `startActivity(intent)` or `startService(intent)`.
    
    ```
    startActivity(intent);
    ```
    
2. Receiving Data:
    
    a. Retrieve the Intent: In the target component (activity or service), retrieve the Intent object that was used to start it.
    
    ```
    Intent intent = getIntent();
    ```
    
    b. Extract the data from the Intent: Extract the data from the Intent using the appropriate method based on the data type you expect.
    
    For example, to retrieve a string value:
    
    ```
    String data = intent.getStringExtra("key");
    ```
    
    Note: The key parameter used in `putExtra()` and `getStringExtra()` should match to ensure correct data retrieval.
    
    c. Process the data: Use the extracted data as needed within the target component.
    
    ```
    // Example: Display the received data in a TextView
    TextView textView = findViewById(R.id.textView);
    textView.setText(data);
    ```
    

## 12. Android Components

In Android development, Android components are fundamental building blocks that define different parts of an application's behavior and functionality. Android components are modular and can be combined to create complex and interactive applications. Here are the main types of Android components:

1. Activities:
Activities represent the user interface (UI) and serve as the entry point for user interactions. Each screen in an Android application is typically implemented as an activity. Activities manage their lifecycle and handle user interactions through methods such as `onCreate()`, `onStart()`, `onResume()`, `onPause()`, `onStop()`, and `onDestroy()`.
2. Services:
Services are background components that perform long-running operations without a user interface. They run independently of activities and can continue to run even if the user switches to another application. Services are often used for tasks like playing music in the background, handling network requests, or performing periodic data synchronization.
3. Broadcast Receivers:
Broadcast Receivers respond to system-wide or application-specific broadcast messages. They listen for and react to broadcast intents, which can be system events like device boot, network connectivity changes, or custom intents sent by other applications. Broadcast Receivers can perform actions in response to these events, such as displaying notifications or triggering other components.
4. Content Providers:
Content Providers manage and expose structured sets of data to other applications. They allow sharing data across applications securely. Content Providers handle data storage, retrieval, and modification operations and enable data sharing through a standardized interface. Examples include the contacts database, media files, or user preferences.
5. Intents:
Intents are messaging objects used to communicate between components. They can be used to start activities, bind to services, send and receive broadcast messages, or pass data between different parts of an application. Intents can carry data as extras and specify the desired action to be performed.

## 13. Activity Lifecycle

![Untitled](SDP%20imp%20Notes%20(VipJet)%2078d0f322425742b9bff34aa9ffe83ef3/Untitled%201.png)

The activity lifecycle in Android refers to the series of states and callbacks that an activity goes through during its lifetime. Understanding the activity lifecycle is crucial for properly managing the behavior and resources of an activity. The lifecycle consists of several key methods that are called at different stages of the activity's existence. Here is an overview of the main stages of the activity lifecycle:

1. onCreate():
This method is called when the activity is first created. It is where you perform initialization tasks, such as inflating the layout, initializing variables, or setting up listeners. The onCreate() method receives the savedInstanceState parameter, which contains any previously saved state data.
2. onStart():
This method is called when the activity becomes visible to the user. At this point, the activity is in the foreground but not yet interactive. You can perform tasks like registering broadcast receivers or preparing UI elements in this method.
3. onResume():
onResume() is called when the activity is about to start interacting with the user. It is the point where the activity is in the foreground and receives user input. In onResume(), you typically start animations, resume sensors or location updates, or initialize resources that were paused or released in onPause().
4. onPause():
onPause() is called when the activity is partially visible or about to lose focus. It is a good place to save data that should be persisted or release resources that are no longer needed. Avoid performing time-consuming tasks in this method, as it may cause a delay in transitioning to the next activity.
5. onStop():
onStop() is called when the activity is no longer visible to the user. It occurs when another activity comes to the foreground or the activity is being destroyed. In this method, you can save any necessary persistent data or release resources that are not needed when the activity is not visible.
6. onRestart():
onRestart() is called when the activity is being restarted after being stopped. It is followed by onStart() and onResume().
7. onDestroy():
This method is called when the activity is being destroyed. It happens either because the activity finishes or the system needs to reclaim resources. Clean up any resources, unregister listeners, or perform final operations in onDestroy().

## 14. Broadcast Receivers:

Broadcast Receivers respond to system-wide or application-specific broadcast messages. They listen for and react to broadcast intents, which can be system events like device boot, network connectivity changes, or custom intents sent by other applications. Broadcast Receivers can perform actions in response to these events, such as displaying notifications or triggering other components.

## 15. Implicit intent vs Explicit intent

1. **Explicit Intents**:
An explicit intent is used when you want to specify the target component explicitly. It explicitly identifies the specific component (activity, service, or broadcast receiver) that should handle the intent. Explicit intents are typically used within the same application to start a specific component within the app.
    
    Example:
    
    ```
    Intent explicitIntent = new Intent(SourceActivity.this, TargetActivity.class);
    startActivity(explicitIntent);
    ```
    
    In the example above, the explicit intent is created with the source activity (`SourceActivity.this`) and the target activity (`TargetActivity.class`). It explicitly specifies the target component by mentioning the class name.
    
2. **Implicit Intents:**
An implicit intent does not specify the exact target component by class name but instead describes an action to be performed. The system then resolves the intent based on its action and the available components that can handle that action. Implicit intents are useful when you want to perform an action that can be handled by multiple components, either within your app or by external applications.
    
    Example:
    
    ```
    Intent implicitIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);
    implicitIntent.setData(Uri.parse("<https://www.example.com>"));
    startActivity(implicitIntent);
    ```
    
    In the example above, the implicit intent is created with the action `Intent.ACTION_VIEW`, which indicates that the intent is meant to view something. The intent also sets the data to be viewed as a URI (`https://www.example.com`). The system then resolves this intent and presents the user with a list of apps that can handle the action of viewing a webpage, and the user can choose the desired app to handle the intent.
    

Implicit intents can be used for a variety of actions, such as sending emails, making phone calls, sharing content, accessing device features, and more. By using implicit intents, you can allow the user to choose how they want to handle a specific action and provide flexibility in utilizing available components.

## 16. PhoneGap and its Advantages

PhoneGap is a cross-platform mobile app development framework that allows developers to create native apps for iOS, Android, Windows Phone, BlackBerry, and other platforms using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. PhoneGap apps are built using web technologies, but they can be packaged and deployed as native apps to each platform's app store.

**Advantages of PhoneGap**

- **Plugins:** PhoneGap has a large library of plugins that can be used to add features to apps, such as GPS, camera, and social media integration.

**Disadvantages of PhoneGap**

- **Performance:** PhoneGap apps can sometimes suffer from performance issues, especially on devices with less powerful hardware.
- **Customization:** PhoneGap apps can be difficult to customize to match the look and feel of a specific platform.
- **Security:** PhoneGap apps are not as secure as native apps, because they are built using web technologies.

Overall, PhoneGap is a good option for developers who want to build cross-platform mobile apps quickly and easily. However, it is important to be aware of the potential performance and security issues before using PhoneGap for development.

Here are some additional advantages of PhoneGap:

- **Faster time to market:** PhoneGap can help developers get their apps to market faster by allowing them to build a single app that can be deployed to multiple platforms.
- **Reduced development costs:** PhoneGap can help developers reduce development costs by eliminating the need to learn multiple programming languages and frameworks.
- **Increased developer productivity:** PhoneGap can help developers increase their productivity by providing a familiar development environment and a wide range of pre-built components and plugins.

## 17. Types of CSS

There are three types of CSS: inline, internal, and external.

- **Inline CSS** is the simplest type of CSS. It is used to style individual HTML elements by adding the `style` attribute to the element's opening tag. For example, the following code would set the font size of the `h1` element to 24px:

**Code snippet**

```
<h1 style="font-size: 24px">This is a heading</h1>
```

- **Internal CSS** is used to style multiple HTML elements by placing the CSS rules in the `style` element of the `head` section of the HTML document. For example, the following code would set the font size of all `h1` elements to 24px:

**Code snippet**

```
<head>
  <style>
    h1 {
      font-size: 24px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
```

- **External CSS** is used to style multiple HTML elements by creating a separate CSS file and linking to it from the `head` section of the HTML document. For example, the following code would link to a CSS file called `styles.css`:

**Code snippet**

```
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
```

The CSS file would then contain the CSS rules, such as the following code:

**Code snippet**

```
h1 {
  font-size: 24px;
}
```

External CSS is the most commonly used type of CSS because it allows you to keep your CSS code separate from your HTML code. This makes it easier to maintain and update your CSS code.

Here are some of the advantages and disadvantages of each type of CSS:

- **Inline CSS**
    - Advantages:
        - Easy to use
        - Can be used to style individual HTML elements
    - Disadvantages:
        - Can be difficult to maintain
        - Can make HTML code more difficult to read
- **Internal CSS**
    - Advantages:
        - Easy to use
        - Can be used to style multiple HTML elements
        - Can be kept separate from HTML code
    - Disadvantages:
        - Can make HTML code more difficult to read
- **External CSS**
    - Advantages:
        - Easy to maintain
        - Can be kept separate from HTML code
        - Can be reused across multiple HTML documents
    - Disadvantages:
        - Can be more difficult to set up
        - Can be slower to load than inline or internal CSS

## 18. Html Layout Tags

HTML layout tags are a group of HTML elements that are used to define the structure and layout of a web page. They include the following elements:

- **header:** The header tag defines the header of a web page. It is typically used to display the title of the page, as well as other important information such as the page's navigation menu.
- **nav:** The nav tag defines the navigation of a web page. It is typically used to display a list of links to other pages on the website.
- **section:** The section tag defines a section of a web page. It can be used to group related content together, such as articles, blog posts, or product listings.
- **article:** The article tag defines an independent, self-contained piece of content. It can be used to display news articles, blog posts, product descriptions, or other types of content.
- **aside:** The aside tag defines content that is related to the main content of a web page, but is not essential. It can be used to display sidebars, comments, or other types of supplementary content.
- **footer:** The footer tag defines the footer of a web page. It is typically used to display copyright information, contact information, or other legal information.

## 19. Html Multimedia tags

HTML multimedia tags are a group of HTML elements that are used to add multimedia content, such as audio and video, to web pages. They include the following elements:

- **<audio>:** The `<audio>` tag is used to add audio content to a web page. It can be used to play back music, sound effects, or other types of audio files.
- **<video>:** The `<video>` tag is used to add video content to a web page. It can be used to play back movies, TV shows, or other types of video files.
- **<embed>:** The `<embed>` tag is used to embed multimedia content from other sources, such as Flash movies or QuickTime videos.
- **<object>:** The `<object>` tag is a more general tag that can be used to embed any type of multimedia content, including audio, video, and Flash movies.

These tags can be used to add multimedia content to web pages in a variety of ways. For example, the following code can be used to add an audio file to a web page:

**Code snippet**

```
<audio controls>
  <source src="my_audio_file.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
  Your browser does not support the audio tag.
</audio>

```

This code will add an audio player to the web page. When the user clicks on the player, the audio file will be played back.

The following code can be used to add a video file to a web page:

**Code snippet**

```
<video controls>
  <source src="my_video_file.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

```

This code will add a video player to the web page. When the user clicks on the player, the video file will be played back.

## 21. Read write internal data storage

Read-write internal data storage is a type of storage that allows an application to read and write data to a file on the device's internal storage. This type of storage is private to the application, meaning that other applications cannot access the data. When the application is uninstalled, the data stored in the internal storage is also removed.

To read and write data to internal storage, an application can use the `openFileOutput()` and `write()` methods. The `openFileOutput()` method creates a file on the device's internal storage, and the `write()` method writes data to the file. The following code shows an example of how to read and write data to internal storage:

**Code snippet**

```
// Create a file on the device's internal storage.
FileOutputStream fos = openFileOutput("myfile.txt", Context.MODE_PRIVATE);

// Write data to the file.
fos.write("This is my data.".getBytes());

// Close the file.
fos.close();
```

To read data from internal storage, an application can use the `openFileInput()` and `read()` methods. The `openFileInput()` method opens a file on the device's internal storage, and the `read()` method reads data from the file. The following code shows an example of how to read data from internal storage:

**Code snippet**

```
// Open a file on the device's internal storage.
FileInputStream fis = openFileInput("myfile.txt");

// Read data from the file.
byte[] data = new byte[fis.available()];
fis.read(data);

// Close the file.
fis.close();

// Convert the data to a string.
String str = new String(data);
```

Read-write internal data storage is a convenient way for applications to store data that needs to be persisted across app launches. However, it is important to note that this type of storage is limited in size, so applications should be careful not to store too much data in internal storage.

## 22. Android Menus

Android menus are a way to let users interact with your app by providing them with a list of actions they can take. There are three main types of menus in Android:

- **Options menus:** These are the most common type of menu and are typically displayed at the top of the screen. They contain actions that are relevant to the entire app, such as "Settings" or "About."
- **Context menus:** These menus appear when the user long-presses on an object in your app. They contain actions that are relevant to the specific object that was long-pressed, such as "Copy" or "Delete."
- **Pop-up menus:** These menus appear when the user taps on a button or icon. They contain a list of options that are relevant to the button or icon that was tapped.

To create a menu in Android, you first need to define it in an XML file. This file will contain the list of menu items, as well as their properties, such as the text that will be displayed, the icon that will be shown, and the action that will be performed when the item is selected. Once you have defined your menu, you can inflate it (load it into memory) and then add it to your app's activity or fragment.

When the user selects a menu item, your app will receive an event notification. You can then handle this event by overriding the appropriate method in your activity or fragment. For example, if the user selects the "Settings" option from the options menu, your app might override the `onOptionsItemSelected()` method and then use the `Intent` class to start a new activity that displays the settings screen.

Here are some additional things to keep in mind when working with menus in Android:

- You can nest menus within each other to create a hierarchical menu structure.
- You can use icons, text, or both to represent menu items.
- You can specify a default action for a menu item, which will be performed if the user presses the `Enter` key while the item is selected.
- You can disable or enable menu items to prevent the user from selecting them.
- You can remove menu items from the menu.

## 23. Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM)

The Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM) is a virtual machine that runs on Android devices. It executes Dalvik bytecode, which is a compiled form of Java bytecode. The DVM is designed to be efficient and lightweight, which makes it ideal for running on mobile devices.

In Android Studio, the DVM is used to run your Android applications. When you build an Android application, the Java code in your project is compiled into Dalvik bytecode. This bytecode is then packaged into an .apk file, which is the format that Android applications are distributed in. When you install an .apk file on an Android device, the DVM on the device will load and execute the Dalvik bytecode in the .apk file.

The DVM is a key part of the Android platform. It allows developers to write Android applications in Java, which is a popular and well-supported programming language. The DVM also makes it possible for Android devices to run Java applications, which gives users access to a wider range of software.

Here are some of the key features of the DVM:

- It is a register-based virtual machine, which makes it more efficient than stack-based virtual machines like the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- It uses a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, which compiles Dalvik bytecode into native machine code at runtime. This makes the DVM more efficient than interpreted virtual machines.
- It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, which makes it ideal for running on mobile devices.

The DVM is a powerful and versatile virtual machine that plays an important role in the Android platform. It allows developers to write Android applications in Java and gives users access to a wider range of software.

## 24 SMS sending in android

SMS, or Short Message Service, is a text messaging service that allows users to send and receive short messages between mobile phones. In Android Studio, you can use the SmsManager class to send and receive SMS messages from your Android application.

To send an SMS message, you need to create an instance of the SmsManager class and call the sendTextMessage() method. The sendTextMessage() method takes three arguments:

- The phone number of the recipient
- The message to send
- A PendingIntent object that will be used to handle the delivery of the message

The PendingIntent object is used to handle the delivery of the message in two ways:

- If the message is successfully delivered, the PendingIntent will be triggered and your application will be notified.
- If the message fails to be delivered, the PendingIntent will also be triggered and your application will be notified of the failure.

To receive an SMS message, you need to register a BroadcastReceiver for the SMS_RECEIVED intent. When an SMS message is received, the BroadcastReceiver will be triggered and your application will be notified of the message.

Here is an example of how to send an SMS message from an Android application:

**Code snippet**

```
// Get the SmsManager instance
SmsManager smsManager = SmsManager.getDefault();

// Set the phone number and message
String phoneNumber = "1234567890";
String message = "This is an SMS message";

// Send the message
smsManager.sendTextMessage(phoneNumber, null, message, null, null)
```

Here is an example of how to register a BroadcastReceiver for the SMS_RECEIVED intent:

**Code snippet**

```
public class MyBroadcastReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {

    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
        // Get the SMS message
        Bundle extras = intent.getExtras();
        String message = extras.getString("android.provider.Telephony.SMS_RECEIVED");

        // Do something with the message
    }
}
```

The SmsManager class and the SMS_RECEIVED intent are two powerful tools that you can use to send and receive SMS messages from your Android applications.

## 25. Different Layouts

1. LinearLayout:
LinearLayout arranges child views in either a horizontal or vertical orientation. Child views are laid out one after another in the specified orientation. You can control the width and height of the child views using layout weights or fixed values.
2. RelativeLayout:
RelativeLayout allows you to position child views relative to one another or relative to the parent layout. Child views can be aligned to the top, bottom, left, right, or center of the parent layout, or they can be positioned based on their relationships to other views.
3. ConstraintLayout:
ConstraintLayout is a flexible and powerful layout that allows you to create complex UI designs. It uses constraints to define the position and size of child views relative to the parent layout or other views. ConstraintLayout supports building responsive and adaptive user interfaces.
4. FrameLayout:
FrameLayout is a simple layout that allows you to stack multiple child views on top of each other. It is often used as a container for fragments or to show a single child view at a time. Views are stacked based on their order of appearance in the XML layout.
5. GridLayout:
GridLayout arranges child views in a grid-like structure with rows and columns. It allows you to specify the number of rows and columns and control the size and alignment of child views within the grid cells. GridLayout is useful for creating evenly distributed grid layouts.
6. TableLayout:
TableLayout organizes child views in rows and columns, similar to an HTML table. It allows you to create a grid-like structure where each cell can contain one or more child views. TableLayout is suitable for displaying tabular data or creating form-like layouts.
7. CoordinatorLayout:
CoordinatorLayout is a specialized layout that works in conjunction with the Android Design Support Library. It provides advanced behaviors and interactions, such as collapsing toolbars, hiding/showing views, and responding to scroll events. CoordinatorLayout is commonly used for creating complex, interactive UI designs.
8. ScrollView:
ScrollView is a layout that allows you to scroll vertically or horizontally to view the contents that are larger than the available screen space. It can contain only one direct child view, but you can place multiple child views within the ScrollView by using a container layout.

## 26. View and View Groups

A View is the basic building block of the user interface in Android. It is a small rectangular box that can be used to display text, images, or other content. Views can also be used to respond to user input, such as clicks, touches, or movements.

A ViewGroup is a special type of View that can contain other Views. This allows you to create complex layouts by arranging Views in a hierarchy. ViewGroups also provide a number of features that make it easier to work with layouts, such as measuring, positioning, and animating Views.

Some common ViewGroups include:

- LinearLayout: This ViewGroup arranges Views in a single line, either horizontally or vertically.
- RelativeLayout: This ViewGroup allows you to position Views relative to each other, rather than to the edges of the screen.
- FrameLayout: This ViewGroup allows you to place Views over each other, so that only one View is visible at a time.
- TableLayout: This ViewGroup arranges Views in a table, with rows and columns.

Views and ViewGroups are essential for creating user interfaces in Android. By understanding how they work, you can create beautiful, responsive, and user-friendly apps.

Here are some additional details about Views and ViewGroups:

- **Views:** Views are the basic building blocks of the user interface in Android. They are responsible for displaying content and responding to user input.
- **ViewGroups:** ViewGroups are containers for Views. They allow you to organize Views into a hierarchy and control how they are displayed.
- **Layouts:** Layouts are a way of organizing Views and ViewGroups. They provide a way to specify the size, position, and appearance of Views.
- **The View hierarchy:** The View hierarchy is a tree-like structure that represents the relationship between Views and ViewGroups. The root of the View hierarchy is the Window object.
- **The View event model:** The View event model is a way of handling user input events. When a user interacts with a View, the View sends an event to the event listener. The event listener can then handle the event in any way it wants.

## 27. Store data to external storage

To store data to external storage using a file stream in Android Studio, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new file in your project called `FileOutputStream.java`.
2. In the `FileOutputStream.java` file, add the following code:

**Code snippet**

```
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileOutputStream {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        // Create a new file in the external storage directory.
        File file = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "myfile.txt");

        // Create a new file output stream.
        FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(file);

        // Write data to the file output stream.
        fos.write("Hello, world!".getBytes());

        // Close the file output stream.
        fos.close();
    }
}
```

1. Compile and run the `FileOutputStream.java` file.
2. The file `myfile.txt` will be created in the external storage directory. The file will contain the text "Hello, world!".

Here is a breakdown of the code:

- The `import` statements import the necessary classes from the Java standard library.
- The `main()` method is the entry point for the program.
- The `File` class represents a file on the file system.
- The `FileOutputStream` class represents a stream of bytes that can be written to a file.
- The `write()` method writes the specified byte array to the file output stream.
- The `close()` method closes the file output stream.

## 28. SQLite DB creation, insertion

SQLite is a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. SQLite is a popular choice for mobile and embedded development because it is small, fast, and easy to use.

To create a SQLite database, you can use the following steps:

1. Create a new file with a .sqlite extension.
2. Open the file in a text editor and add the following code:

**Code snippet**

```
CREATE TABLE my_table (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT,
  age INTEGER
);
```

1. Save the file.

To insert data into a SQLite table, you can use the following steps:

1. Open a database connection to the SQLite database.
2. Create a Cursor object.
3. Execute an INSERT statement.
4. Close the database connection.

The following code shows how to insert data into a SQLite table:

**Code snippet**

```
import sqlite3

# Create a database connection
conn = sqlite3.connect("my_database.sqlite")

# Create a Cursor object
cur = conn.cursor()

# Execute an INSERT statement
cur.execute("INSERT INTO my_table (name, age) VALUES ('John Doe', 30)")

# Commit the changes to the database
conn.commit()

# Close the database connection
conn.close()
```

This code will insert a new row into the my_table table with the name "John Doe" and the age 30.
