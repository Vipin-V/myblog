## Laws of Logic in Discrete Mathematics

The laws of logic are a set of rules that govern how logical statements can be combined and manipulated. These laws are essential for reasoning and problem-solving in discrete mathematics.

**Basic Laws of Logic**

The following are some of the most basic laws of logic:

- **Commutative laws:**
  - p ∨ q ≡ q ∨ p
  - p ∧ q ≡ q ∧ p
- **Associative laws:**
  - p ∨ (q ∨ r) ≡ (p ∨ q) ∨ r
  - p ∧ (q ∧ r) ≡ (p ∧ q) ∧ r
- **Identity laws:**
  - p ∨ 1 ≡ p
  - p ∧ 1 ≡ p
- **Idempotent laws:**
  - p ∨ p ≡ p
  - p ∧ p ≡ p
- **Double negation:**
  - ¬¬p ≡ p

**More Advanced Laws of Logic**

The following are some more advanced laws of logic:

- **De Morgan's laws:**
  - ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ ¬p ∨ ¬q
  - ¬(p ∨ q) ≡ ¬p ∧ ¬q
- **Distributive laws:**
  - p ∨ (q ∧ r) ≡ (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ r)
  - p ∧ (q ∨ r) ≡ (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r)
- **Absorption laws:**
  - p ∨ (p ∧ q) ≡ p
  - p ∧ (p ∨ q) ≡ p
- **Contradiction law:**
  - p ∧ ¬p ≡ F
- **Tautology law:**
  - p ∨ ¬p ≡ T

**Inverse Laws:**

- p ∨ ¬p ≡ T
- p ∧ ¬p ≡ F

**Domination Laws:**

- p ∨ T ≡ T
- p ∧ F ≡ F

**Examples**

The following are some examples of how the laws of logic can be used to simplify logical expressions and to prove theorems:

(p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ ¬q) ≡ p ∨ q ∧ ¬q (by the domination laws)

- **Proving a theorem:**

Theorem: If p → q and q → r, then p → r.

**Proof**:\*\*

p → q (premise)
q → r (premise)
¬p ∨ q (by modus ponens from 1)
¬p ∨ r (by modus ponens from 2 and 3)
p → r (by the law of contraposition)
