- They communicate well about their thoughts and feelings, and give you the chance to do the same.
- They're passionate about something. Having something that makes them happy outside of a relationship is a good sign they can be independent and won't rely on you for all their emotional needs.
- They can admit fault when talking about past relationships.
- They're excited about the things that make you different, not just the things that make you conventionally attractive.
- They ask you for your opinion and advice as often as they offer theirs.
- They're willing to do un-fun, un-sexy stuff with you.
- When talking about previous relationships that didn't work out, they admit fault and regret.
- They always ask you before making a decision that affects you.
- They respect your decisions and emotions even when you can't logically explain them.
- You feel safe disagreeing with them.
- They set boundaries with you, and they do it in a matter-of-fact, respectful way.

- Rude to the server for no reason, or rude to other people at a different table, maybe he's just rude.
- Tying to push past your boundaries.
- They get serious too fast. If pushing for commitment early, it might be because of an insecurity or lacking emotional intelligence. If things are too good to be true, they probably are.
- They act irresponsibly. Financial irresponsibility, clinging on to their parents, inappropriate social behavior.
- Disrespectful in backhanded compliments and straight-up insults. Are they trying to break your self-esteem so they can control you?
- Drama king or queen.
- They play dating games, pick-up games that all lead to people wasting their time and getting hurt. If someone is actually interested in you, they should show it fairly consistently.
- Issues in the bedroom.
- They show no interests in your interests (or worse, deride them.)
